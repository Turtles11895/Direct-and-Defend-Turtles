-If there's lag - save and load the scene to delete dead units. If your computer can handle it the game will delete the dead units anyway after a few minutes

>Que es?
This is a game like the Command & Conquer series but in its own style. Enemies are procedurally spawned and the player must defend, make money, and attack the enemy. Each unit is unique (targeting, strategic ability, weapons) and there are multiple alternative units the player can use to win. The player must learn how to use each unit or play in sandbox mode so that they can defend well. More info in game~
